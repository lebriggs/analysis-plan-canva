## Author

* Laura Briggs

## Description

* This repository contains an R script (or file) designed for cleaning and preparing a dataset used in a workshop on creating a data pre-analysis plan using Canva.

## Repository Contents

1. README.md file
2. R script ("setup.R"): R script for connecting R to GitHub.
3. R script ("20240124_nero_offspring_analysis.R"): Contains code for cleaning and pre-processing the dataset to prepare it for analysis.

## Creation Date

The R file was created on:
* 24 January 2024

## Workshop Overview

* This R script accompanied a 30-minute hands-on workshop where participants learned to create a robust data pre-analysis plan using Canva. 
* The workshop included a completed example using an authentic canine health dataset, highlighting the benefits of structured pre-analysis planning and improving data analysis decision making skills.

## Workshop Learning Outcomes

By the end of this workshop, participants were able to:

- Understand the advantages of creating a data pre-analysis plan in Canva.
- Identify the six sections of a robust data pre-analysis plan.
- Know how to add and read comments on an existing data pre-analysis plan in Canva.
- Recognize when and how to integrate a data pre-analysis plan into their own projects.
- Leave with an editable version of the example discussed in the workshop that can be modified to suit their own work.

These outcomes guided the design and implementation of the R script provided in this repository, ensuring it meets the educational goals of the workshop.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Data Processing Example**: The Canva whiteboard walks through processing each column of a German Shepherd Dog health dataset, detailing essential steps such as using regular expressions for data separation and converting columns to factors like sex and colour. The included R script executes these steps.

- **Normalization of Orthopedic Rating Systems**: Demonstrates how to normalize hip and elbow ratings across different North American and German rating systems, ensuring consistency and comparability.

- **Educational Focus**: Detailed comments for each line of code in the R file explain the reasoning and methodology behind data cleaning and preparation.

- **Practical Application**: Provides a hands-on approach to data analysis preparation, showing how to scrape data, transform raw data into a structured format suitable for analysis, and include functions for simple counts and basic data summaries.
